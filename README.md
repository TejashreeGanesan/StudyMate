**StudyMate**

I developed StudyMate, a responsive web application designed to support group study and collaborative learning among students. The application enables users to find and join study rooms based on their subjects of interest, fostering a collaborative environment where students can learn and grow together.

**Features**
_**Find Study Rooms:**__ _I implemented a feature that allows users to browse and search for study rooms based on their academic interests. This functionality makes it easy for students to find relevant rooms and connect with others studying similar subjects.

_**Join and Collaborate: **_ I created a system where users can join study rooms and engage in collaborative study sessions. This feature supports interactive and peer-driven learning, enhancing the educational experience for students.

Responsive Design: The application is designed to be fully responsive, ensuring that it functions seamlessly across various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones. I focused on creating a user-friendly interface that adapts to different screen sizes.

Tech Stack
Backend: I used Django, a powerful web framework, to handle the server-side logic, user management, and data processing. Djangoâ€™s robust features and scalability were crucial in building the application's backend infrastructure.

Frontend: For the frontend, I utilized HTML and CSS to design and implement a clean, intuitive interface. These technologies allowed me to create a visually appealing and accessible application that enhances the user experience.
